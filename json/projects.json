Our primary objective is the development of an e-commerce website called 'Clo', with a specific focus on clothing retail. The project workflow began with the design and creation of a prototype using Figma, followed by the implementation of the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Subsequently, we constructed the back-end, utilizing Node.js with Express and Prisma. We also designed a relational database named 'clo_db' for efficient data storage, employing PostgreSQL. We are using Github Page for Front-End deployment, Railway for Back-End deployment, and Supabase for database deployment."
